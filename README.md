<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nithinkaira021/sneakers-e-commerce.git
   ```

2. Back end:
   * Configure your database connection details in an `app.config` file.
   * Build and run the solution file from the "Backend" folder in Visual Studio.

> Note: This project is dated, and there are many aspects I would approach differently now. I am no longer actively developing it. However, if you intend to clone or fork it: The database was initially set up using SQL statements, which were not saved. Starting the project may be challenging due to this. I recommend using Entity Framework's update-database command to recreate the database schema based on the models.


3. Front end:
   * Navigate to the "Frontend" directory 
   * Install required npm packages   

     ```sh
     npm install
     ```
     
   * Start the front end development server   

     ```sh
     npm start
     ```
